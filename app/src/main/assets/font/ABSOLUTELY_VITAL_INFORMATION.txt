Lacosta is a decorative script typeface, drawn and created by Måns Grebäck during 2020. 

Perfect for company or product logotypes, or any typographic art that requires that classic custom look. 

Included in the family is the Lacosta Line typeface, a swash underlined variation of the original font. 

In addition to being a beautiful, ornamental lettering, it also has a lot of decorative and swash options:
Use the symbols [ ] { } _ to create connections, swashes and decorations.
Example: Extra[ Sweet]

The font contains multiple OpenType functions, and is filled with alternates; stylistic alternates to give extra personality, and contextual alternates to make the letters flow with one another smoothly -- just as a custom logo. 

Lacosta has a very extensive lingual support, covering all European Latin scripts.
The font contains all characters you'll ever need, including all punctuation and numbers.
